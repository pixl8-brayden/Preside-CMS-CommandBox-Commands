## 6.1.2

* Add ability for other packages to do programatic installs and skip the preside package compatibility checking

## 6.1.1

* When doing version compatibility checks, ignore snapshot part of version strings. i.e. 4.3.0-SNAPSHOT4598 should just be treated as 4.3.0

## 6.1.0

* Add ability for Preside extensions to expression compatibility issues with other extensions.

## 6.0.1-3

* Build fixes

## 6.0.0

* A whole new version of `preside new extension` that includes scaffolds for tests and Github actions flow for publishing to forgebox.

## 5.0.3

* Allow `preside start` to be run in non-interactive shell with `preside start interactive=false`

## 5.0.1

## 2.1.8 > 3.0.2

* Remove whitespace reduction setting from the Lucee web config. This stops the preside commands from failing to format tables properly (e.g. with `cache stats` command).

## 2.0.4 > 2.1.0

* Add new webapp skeleton for creating non-cms based web applications on Preside
* Added a post install concept for skeletons

## 0.6.0 > 2.0.4

* Updated skeleton for `preside new site` command to use forgebox packages (in readiness for multiple skeleton options and simplifying the build process)
* Use a hires icon for `preside start` servers on Linux machines (now that we will have working AppIndicators in Linux with CommandBox)
* Do not prompt to download preside when we find preside already located in the webroot of the project when running `preside start` for the first time
